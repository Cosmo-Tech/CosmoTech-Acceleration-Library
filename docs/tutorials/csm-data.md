# CSM-DATA

`csm-data` is a CLI (Command Line Interface) bundled inside CoAL.

It's multiple commands are there to help you go faster in most of your interaction with services used inside a CosmoTech
platform.

You can get the full help of the commands at that location : [csm-data](../../csm-data)

## Why should I use `csm-data` ?

Use of `csm-data` is recommended to have fast and tested interactions with the multiple services provided during a
CosmoTech simulation.

You can make use of the commands bundled inside the CLI to reduce your own development time by not having to recreate
the wheel everytime you need to send X or Y data to a service.

You are free to look at the code of the commands and use it as a basis for your own specific needs if the commands do
not exactly work as you would need (for example some commands only scan single level folders for files while you would
want a full recursive look-up)
