  Reads a folder CSVs and send those to the Cosmo Tech API as a Dataset

  CSVs must follow a given format:
    - Nodes files must have an id column
    - Relationship files must have id, src and dest columns

  Non-existing relationship (aka dest or src does not point to existing node) won't trigger an error,
  the relationship will not be created instead.

  Requires a valid connection to the API to send the data
parameters:
  api_url: The URI to a Cosmo Tech API instance
  organization_id: An organization id for the Cosmo Tech API
  workspace_id: A workspace id for the Cosmo Tech API
  runner_id: A runner id for the Cosmo Tech API
  dir: Path to the directory containing csvs to send
  clear: Flag to clear the target dataset first (if set to True will clear the dataset before sending anything, irreversibly)
