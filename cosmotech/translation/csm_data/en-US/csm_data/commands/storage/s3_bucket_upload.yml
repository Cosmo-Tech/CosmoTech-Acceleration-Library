  Upload a folder to a S3 Bucket

  Will upload everything from a given folder to a S3 bucket. If a single file is passed only it will be uploaded, and recursive will be ignored

  Giving a prefix will add it to every upload (finishing the prefix with a "/" will allow to upload in a folder inside the bucket)

  Make use of the boto3 library to access the bucket
